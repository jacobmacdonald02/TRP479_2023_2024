Problem 1
read in the file `Hist_stations.txt`
check the first and last 5 rows using the head() and tail() methods
check the datatypes using the .dtypes attribute
create new columns for latitude and longitude and extract the relevant information from the location attribute (tip: take a few minutes to work out which value is which).
Tip: you may want to look at the .split() string method which splits a string based on a charater; e.g.  `.str.split(" ")` will split a string where there is a whitespace; `.str.split(":")` will split a string based on a colon (:) etc


Problem 2
read in the file ‘Sheffield_weather.txt’
this file uses whitespace as a delimiter between values rather than a comma. (tip: the parameter delim_whitespace is false by default and specifies whether or not whitespace (e.g. ' ' or '    ') will be used as the delimiter.)
create a 'YEAR_MONTH' columnt to hold a uniques identifier for each entry
Tip: the pandas method `astype(str)` will convert a numerical format into a string (obejct) format; e.g. data['year'].astype(str) will convert an integer 'year' value to a string value.
calculate the average yearly temperature from 1883 to 2020
Tip: to convert string to float use pd.to_numeric(dataframe["year"], errors='coerce') - this last statement forces and non-numerical characters to a NaN value (which is ignored in computations)Spring is considered to be the months March, April and May; calculate the average Spring rainfall since 1883
